# ops-bedrock

This package is made usable by the root `Makefile`. It can spin up
a `docker-compose` based bedrock developer network.

To spin up a local devnet:

```bash
$ make devnet-up
```

To spin down the devnet:

```bash
$ make devnet-down
```

To wipe the devnet:

```bash
$ make devnet-clean
```
