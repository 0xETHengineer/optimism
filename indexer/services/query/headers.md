# [services/query/headers.go](./headers.go)

Provides a function `HeaderByNumberWithRetry` that retrieves the latest block header from the Ethereum network with a retry mechanism in case of failure.

- **Overview**

HeaderByNumberWithRetry takes two parameters: a context.Context for managing timeouts and cancellations and an *ethclient.Client, which is a client for interacting with the Ethereum network.

It creates a backoff.DoCtx function that will be called up to three times in case of failure, using an exponential backoff strategy. The backoff strategy means that the time between each retry will exponentially increase, reducing the load on the network in case of repeated failures.

The function passed to backoff.DoCtx will call the client.HeaderByNumber method with nil as the block number, which means that it will retrieve the latest block header. If there is an error, this error will be returned and backoff.DoCtx will retry the operation according to its strategy.

After backoff.DoCtx has finished (either by succeeding or exhausting its retries), the result of the client.HeaderByNumber call and any error are returned.

This function could be used in any situation where you need to reliably retrieve the latest block header from the Ethereum network, even in the face of transient network failures.
