# Optimistic specs

Shared open-source specification for an optimistic-rollup that strives for 1:1 Ethereum on L2 while minimizing additional code.

The dream: *EVM compatibility, all Execution clients, all L1 tooling, L2 security (rollup), no L1-like limits*

This project is a combined effort of the Optimism, EF research and Quilt/Consensys research teams.

Enabling rollups on execution-layer data today, and shard-data in the future.

[**Specs overview**](./overview.md) - experimental!

Components (under construction):
- [Execution Engine Usage](./components/exec_engine.md)
- [Fraud Proof Generator](./components/fraud_proof_gen.md)
- [Layer 1](./components/layer1.md)
- [Rollup Node](./components/rollup_node.md)
