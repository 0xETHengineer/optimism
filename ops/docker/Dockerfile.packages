# This Dockerfile builds all the dependencies needed by the monorepo, and should
# be used to build any of the follow-on services
#

# Stage 0 (named `manifests`) collects
# dependency manifest files (`package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`) which are then
# used by stage 1 to install these dependencies
# development. The only reason we need a separate stage just for collecting the
# dependency manifests is that Docker's `COPY` command still does not allow
# copying based on a glob pattern (see this GitHub issue for more details
# https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15858). Being able to copy only manifests
# into stage 1 (the `COPY --from=manifests` statement) is important to maximize
# Docker build cache hit rate. `alpine` is chosen as the base image for the
# first stage because it's the smallest image that have access to the `cp
# --parents -t` command (by installing the `coreutils` package).
